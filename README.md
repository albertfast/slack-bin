# Slack (Unofficial AUR Package)

This is an unofficial PKGBUILD for Slack‚Äôs official desktop client, built specifically for Arch Linux and Arch-based distributions.

The package does **not** redistribute Slack binaries. Instead, it fetches the latest official `.rpm` release from Slack‚Äôs CDN at build time, extracts it, and installs it properly on Arch systems.

---

## üîß Installation

To install this package using an AUR helper:

```bash
yay -S slack
```

Slack will be downloaded directly from the official Slack CDN and installed.

---

## üÜï Updating the PKGBUILD (for maintainers)

To update the package with the latest version of Slack:

```bash
./update-slack.sh
makepkg -si
```

This script will:
- Fetch the latest `.rpm` download URL from Slack
- Extract the version number automatically
- Update the `pkgver` and `source` fields in the `PKGBUILD`
- Regenerate the `.SRCINFO`
- Download the `.rpm` and install the package

This process ensures the AUR package always stays up-to-date with Slack‚Äôs latest release.
